# Capture the Flag - FAQ

The following page is meant to be a quick primer on what this event is and to help you troubleshoot some of the most common blockers. If for whatever reason you find yourself getting frustrated or stuck by something not covered here or elsewhere, please immediately take your question to an xPerts staff member who can help unstick you!

**Q: What is a CTF event?**

**A:** "CTF" stands for "Capture the Flag". In cybersecurity this refers to a sort of 'digital scavenger hunt' where you're tasked with discovering certain values through a mix of technical skill and puzzle solving abilities. This type of event is deeply rooted in cybersecurity culture dating all the way back to DEFCON '93. For this specific instance you'll be given a series of progressive challenges worth varying amounts of points. These points can optionally be spent on hints to solve other harder challenges. Whichever individual or team accumulates the highest point total within the allotted time is declared the winner... but some might argue that the real winners are those who made friendships along the way... those people are wrong--highest points definitely wins so check the scoreboard here periodically.

**Q: I'm having trouble with access, what do I do?**

**A:** There are a lot of logistics behind the scenes to set an event like this up. You'll need a lot of different accesses to successfully complete these challenges and there are a ton of opportunities for things to go wrong. If you're struggling to log in or access a tool, don't toil on it. Reach out in to a xPerts staff member and request they help you ASAP so you don't lose any cycles!

**Q: My internet is slow or one of the component tools are slow for me, what do I do?**

**A:** Unfortunately, the internet kind of sucks sometimes. We've made conscious efforts to mitigate load/access issues as much as we can, but the reality is that even with the best effort there is still a chance that things can go awry. If FortiCNAPP, CTFd, or any other component piece is slow/inaccessible, try your best to improvise. Use a mobile hotspot if you have one, piggyback on a friend's laptop/screenshare, pray to the event gods for mercy. We'll let you know if any workarounds exist for known problems but as long as you don't cheat it won't be considered cheating!

**Q: When I try to submit answers to challenges, nothing happens!**

**A:** CTFd is a little janky sometimes. It's possible that you haven't properly signed in or your session has timed out. You'll be able to view the challenges but you won't be able to submit any answers or see any previous progress. All you should need to do is login again!
