# Images

While images are first-class citizens of Markdown and part of the core syntax,
it can be difficult to work with them. Material for MkDocs makes working with
images more comfortable, providing styles for image alignment and image
captions.

## Image alignment

Images can be aligned by adding the
respective alignment directions via the `align` attribute, i.e. `align=left` or
`align=right`:

=== "Left"

    ``` markdown
    ![Image title](https://dummyimage.com/600x400/eee/aaa){ align=left }
    ```

    <div class="result" markdown>

    ![Image title](https://dummyimage.com/600x400/f5f5f5/aaaaaa?text=–%20Image%20–){ align=left width=300 }

    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod
    nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor
    massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa.

    </div>

=== "Right"

    ``` markdown
    ![Image title](https://dummyimage.com/600x400/eee/aaa){ align=right }
    ```

    <div class="result" markdown>

    ![Image title](https://dummyimage.com/600x400/f5f5f5/aaaaaa?text=–%20Image%20–){ align=right width=300 }

    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod
    nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor
    massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa.

    </div>

If there's insufficient space to render the text next to the image, the image
will stretch to the full width of the viewport, e.g. on mobile viewports.

??? question "Why is there no centered alignment?"

    The [`align`][align] attribute doesn't allow for centered alignment, which
    is why this option is not supported by Material for MkDocs.[^1] Instead,
    the [image captions] syntax can be used, as captions are optional.

  [^1]:
    You might also realize that the [`align`][align] attribute has been
    deprecated as of HTML5, so why use it anyways? The main reason is
    portability – it's still supported by all browsers and clients, and is very
    unlikely to be completely removed, as many older websites still use it. This
    ensures a consistent appearance when a Markdown file with these attributes
    is viewed outside of a website generated by Material for MkDocs.

### Image captions

Sadly, the Markdown syntax doesn't provide native support for image captions,
but it's always possible to use the [Markdown in HTML] extension with literal
`figure` and `figcaption` tags:

``` html
<figure markdown="span">
  ![Image title](https://dummyimage.com/600x400/){ width="300" }
  <figcaption>Image caption</figcaption>
</figure>
```

<div class="result">
  <figure>
    <img src="https://dummyimage.com/600x400/f5f5f5/aaaaaa?text=–%20Image%20–" width="300" />
    <figcaption>Image caption</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

### Image lazy-loading

Modern browsers provide [native support for lazy-loading images][lazy-loading]
through the `loading=lazy` directive, which degrades to eager-loading in
browsers without support:

``` markdown
![Image title](https://dummyimage.com/600x400/){ loading=lazy }
```

<div class="result" markdown>
  <img src="https://dummyimage.com/600x400/f5f5f5/aaaaaa?text=–%20Image%20–" width="300" />
</div>

### Light and dark mode

If you added a [color palette toggle] and want to show different images for
light and dark color schemes, you can append a `#only-light` or `#only-dark`
hash fragment to the image URL:

``` markdown
![Image title](https://dummyimage.com/600x400/f5f5f5/aaaaaa#only-light)
![Image title](https://dummyimage.com/600x400/21222c/d5d7e2#only-dark)
```

<div class="result" markdown>

![Zelda light world]{ width="300" }
![Zelda dark world]{ width="300" }

</div>

!!! warning "Requirements when using [custom color schemes]"

    The built-in [color schemes] define the aforementioned hash fragments, but
    if you're using [custom color schemes], you'll also have to add the
    following selectors to your scheme, depending on whether it's a light or
    dark scheme:

    === "Custom light scheme"

        ``` css
        [data-md-color-scheme="custom-light"] img[src$="#only-dark"],
        [data-md-color-scheme="custom-light"] img[src$="#gh-dark-mode-only"] {
          display: none; /* Hide dark images in light mode */
        }
        ```

    === "Custom dark scheme"

        ``` css
        [data-md-color-scheme="custom-dark"] img[src$="#only-light"],
        [data-md-color-scheme="custom-dark"] img[src$="#gh-light-mode-only"] {
          display: none; /* Hide light images in dark mode */
        }
        ```
