# Documentation as Code

**Documentation as Code** is an approach to creating and maintaining documentation with the same tools and practices used in software development. It involves treating documentation like source code, using version control, automated testing, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows.

## Key Principles

1. **Version Control**  
   Documentation is stored in a version control system (e.g., Git), allowing for collaboration, tracking changes, and rollback to previous versions. Each change is associated with a commit history, making the documentation process transparent.

2. **Collaboration and Review**  
   Teams can collaborate on documentation using pull requests and code reviews, ensuring high-quality content and reducing the risk of outdated information.

3. **Continuous Integration**  
   Automated workflows are used to build, test, and deploy documentation changes. This may include linting to catch syntax errors, style checks for consistency, or testing code snippets embedded in the documentation.

4. **Consistency with Source Code**  
   Documentation is often kept close to the source code (e.g., in the same repository), ensuring it remains synchronized with the codebase and accurately reflects the current state of the project.

5. **Infrastructure as Code Integration**  
   Documentation practices can be aligned with infrastructure as code (IaC), enabling developers to generate and update documentation based on the infrastructure changes and configurations.

## Benefits

- **Improved Accuracy:** Documentation is updated alongside the code, reducing discrepancies.
- **Enhanced Collaboration:** Teams can follow familiar software development workflows for documentation.
- **Automation:** CI/CD pipelines streamline the deployment of changes and catch errors early.
- **Traceability:** Version control provides a history of changes for compliance and auditing.

## Tools and Practices

- **Markdown and reStructuredText** for writing documentation.
- **Static Site Generators** like [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), or [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/).
- **Continuous Integration Tools** (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) for automated testing and deployment.
- **Linters and Style Checkers** like [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) or [Vale](https://vale.sh/) for quality checks.

## Example Workflow

1. **Create or Update Documentation:** Write content in Markdown within the code repository.
2. **Open a Pull Request:** Submit changes for review.
3. **Automated Checks:** CI tools verify the formatting, style, and embedded code snippets.
4. **Review and Merge:** Team members review the pull request, provide feedback, and merge approved changes.
5. **Deploy:** The changes are automatically deployed to a documentation site.

## Conclusion

**Documentation as Code** empowers teams to create high-quality documentation using the same practices they apply to software development, resulting in more reliable and consistent documentation.
